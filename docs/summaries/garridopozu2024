The Interplay of Syllable Structure and Consonant Sonority in L2 Speech Segmentation. 

Overview
The study investigated whether L1 and L2 Spanish speakers demonstrate sensitivity to matching/mismatching syllable structure and consonant sonority in lexical segmentation in Spanish. 

Methods and Materials 
A total of 81 English-Spanish leaeners and 72 Spanish-English learners completed a fragment-monitoring task. Language proficiency was assessed using four proficiency tests, two in Spanish and two in English, specifically LexTALE, English and Spanish version.The fragment-monitoring task tested whether participants were sensitive to syllable structure and consonant sonority during fragment detection in segmentation of Spanish. This task aimed to replicate prior target-type-by-word-type interactions found in earlier studies in Spanish monolinguals, French monolinguals, and Portuguese monolinguals. 

Results
Findings show that matching/mismatching syllable structure between a
syllabic fragment and a target word affects lexical segmentation in Spanish-speaking L2 learners of English and English-speaking L2 learners of Spanish, but intervocalic consonant sonority modulates this effect. Importantly revealing that the learner's L1 significantly impacts segment sounds in the L2.

This study supports syllabic models of speech segmentation such as the Standard Syllabic Model (Dupoux 1993; Mehler et al. 1981), the Cascade Syllabic Model (Dupoux 1993), and the Semi-Syllables Model (Dupoux 1993) pertaining to the
influence of syllable structure in speech segmentation. However, this study does not state that the syllable have a priviledged role in speech perception, but suggest that the syllable structure in involved in this process of speech segmentation even for L2 learners with a stress-timed L1.
