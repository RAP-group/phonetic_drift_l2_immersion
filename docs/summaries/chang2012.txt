Participants: 36 adult native English speakers with no significant prior exposure to Korean, enrolled in a six-week intensive Korean course in South Korea.
Methods: Two acoustic experiments conducted longitudinally to elicit production of Korean (Experiment 1K) and English (Experiment 2E) at the end of each class week.

Key Findings:
Phonetic Drift in Stop Production:
No significant change in VOT for English voiced stops but an increase in f0 onset for female learners.
Significant lengthening in both VOT and f0 onset for English voiceless stops, aligning with Korean phonetic norms.
Phonetic Drift in Vowel Production:
English vowels for female learners shifted upwards (decreased F1).
English vowels for male learners shifted downwards and forwards in the vowel space (increased F1 and F2).


Cross-linguistic Similarity:
Evidence of cross-language linkages at multiple levels of phonological structure.
L2 learning influences L1 speech production rapidly and assimilatorily, making L1 more similar to L2 phonetic properties.
Conclusion: L2 learning initiates cross-language phonetic influence from the onset, affecting L1 in complex ways that are both general (affecting classes of sounds) and specific (targeting individual phonetic features).
