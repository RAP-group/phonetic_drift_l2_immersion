Temas -- L2 acquisition and L1 attrition in voiceless stop VOT in late English–Arabic and Arabic–English bilinguals.



Methods: 60 participants (15 monolingual Arabic, 15 monolingual English, 15 English–Arabic bilinguals, 15 Arabic–English bilinguals) narrated cartoons to analyze VOT of voiceless plosives.

 Bilinguals attended three sessions; monolinguals two. Tasks were designed to elicit spontaneous speech for a natural linguistic output......



Results:

VOT Values: Bilinguals showed **intermediate VOT values between monolingual norms for similar L2 sounds**. L1 attrition was found in English–Arabic bilinguals' English /k/ productions.

 VOT values, with English VOTs significantly longer than Arabic ones.


**attrition**


Results: Phonetic similarity influenced L2 acquisition, with more difficulty in acquiring similar L2 sounds. L1 attrition was asymmetrical, observed only in English–Arabic bilinguals' English /k/.



Conclusion: Phonetic similarity and markedness contribute to L2 acquisition difficulties and asymmetric L1 attrition patterns.
