American English learners of French after one and six weeks in a study abroad program in Paris. Compare with long-term residents proficient in both languages.

Participants:

Study Abroad Group: 11 American English speakers, novice French learners in Paris for a semester.
Paris Resident Group: 11 American English speakers, proficient in French, living in Paris for at least five years.
Native French Group: 7 native French speakers for control.
Methods: Recordings of American English and French vowels produced by participants after one and six weeks of study abroad, and by long-term residents.


Key Findings:

Study Abroad Group: No evidence of phonetic drift after six weeks.

**Paris Resident Group: Significant shift in American English vowel space along F1, and several vowels moved toward French norms, indicating phonetic drift.**

Influence of L2 on L1: Long-term use of French impacts L1 American English vowel categories, suggesting ongoing bidirectional phonetic influence.
High Vowels Focus:  attention to high vowels attempts to maintain distinct categories between languages despite drift.
