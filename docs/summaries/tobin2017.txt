Accommodation observed in monolingual contexts extends to bilingual individuals,  VOT changes in Spanish-English bilinguals after periods in the US (English environment) and a Spanish-speaking country.

Participants: Ten Spanish native speakers, mostly graduate students, participated. 

Their linguistic backgrounds varied, including differences in exposure to English and Spanish, age of English acquisition, and current language use.

Methodology: Participants read sentences in both Spanish and English at two different times: after spending 3-4 months in the US and after 2-4 weeks in a Spanish-speaking country. VOTs of voiceless plosives were measured to assess phonetic drift.

Results: English VOTs showed drift towards the ambient language's norms, while Spanish VOTs remained unaffected. 

There was considerable individual variation in the extent of English VOT drift, influenced by native-likeness of L2 VOTs and active language use.



Phonetic accommodation occurs in bilinguals, with language environment significantly affecting L2 (English) but not L1 (Spanish) phonetics.
