Investigated how learning a second language (L2) affects first language (L1) pronunciation in native English speakers living in Korea.

Key Findings:
English phonetics changed after moving to Korea, with some changes persisting long after Korean language classes ended.
Changes in L1 phonetics were influenced by the ambient L2 environment, supporting the theory that L2 exposure leads to lasting L1 restructuring.

Methodological Issues:  multilingual individuals with monolinguals in linguistic studies, **NO** language background reporting.


Study Design: A year-long study tracked changes in English pronunciation among participants, differentiating between frequent and infrequent Korean users.

Observations:
Phonetic shifts towards Korean norms occurred during Korean learning and remained for those actively using Korean.

Even minimal L2 use can impact L1 phonetics, shown through vowel changes in less frequent Korean users.
