English vowel learning on the perception of first language (L1) Japanese vowels



Methods and Materials
65 late L1-Japanese speakers of L2 English from Japan and the US, alongside monolingual control groups of 21 Japanese and 18 English speakers. 

(BLP) was administered 

Perception experiments categorization tasks and category goodness rating tasks for both L1 Japanese and L2 English vowels. 

Stimuli for these tasks were synthesized based on the production of monolingual speakers, manipulating vowel formants to create continua between specific vowel pairs (e.g., /i-e/ in Japanese and /i-ɪ/ in English). 


Results:

L1 perceptual drift in a subset of L2 learners who, despite not achieving nativelike categorization in L2 English /i-ɪ/, were dominant in L2 English. 

**reorganization of the L1 phonetic system**

**ability as separate factors**  contribute to phonetic learning outcomes
