Spanish use affects Catalan-Spanish bilinguals' perception and production of Catalan vowels /e/ and /ε/.


Participants were raised in Catalan-speaking families but had significant exposure to Spanish.
Participants: 43 L1 Catalan, highly proficient bilinguals, divided into groups based on their daily use of Catalan........ low (40%-70%) vs. high (80%-100%)



Methods: Perceptual accuracy assessed through categorization and AXB discrimination tasks. Production accuracy evaluated by acoustic analysis of /ε/ in words.
Findings:

Perception: High use of Catalan led to faster discrimination response times, = more efficient processing. Both groups perceived the vowel contrast categorically.

Production: Frequent Spanish use resulted in a Spanish-accented production of Catalan /ε/, especially noticeable in cognate words. 

High Catalan users maintained a clearer distinction between /e/ and /ε/.


Conclusion: 

 impact of L2 usage on L1 vowel perception and production
